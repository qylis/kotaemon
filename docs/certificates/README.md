How to start kotaemon in https mode <https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon>
 
To start Kotaemon in HTTPS mode, you need to configure it to use a secure connection with an SSL certificate. The GitHub repository for Kotaemon (<https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon>) provides details on how to set it up, primarily through its Gradio-based UI and environment variables. Below is a step-by-step guide based on the available documentation and typical Gradio practices, as Kotaemon uses Gradio for its web interface.
 
Prerequisites
 
1. Kotaemon Installed: Ensure you have cloned the repository and installed dependencies as outlined in the README:
 
   * Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon
   * Navigate to the directory: cd kotaemon
   * Install dependencies: pip install -e "libs/kotaemon\[all]" && pip install -e "libs/ktem"
 
2. SSL Certificates: You need a valid SSL certificate (e.g., from Let's Encrypt or a self-signed certificate) with:
 
   * A private key file (e.g., privkey.pem)
   * A certificate file (e.g., cert.pem)
 
3. Environment Setup: Optional but recommended—set up a virtual environment (e.g., with conda create -n kotaemon python=3.10 and conda activate kotaemon).
 
Steps to Start Kotaemon in HTTPS Mode
 
Kotaemon's web UI is built with Gradio, which supports HTTPS via the --ssl-keyfile and --ssl-certfile options when launching. However, Kotaemon provides convenience scripts (run\_windows.bat, run\_linux.sh, etc.) that you can modify or bypass to enable HTTPS. Here's how:
 
1\. Locate the Launch Command
 
* The app is typically launched via app.py in the root directory, which initializes the Gradio interface.
* The convenience scripts (e.g., run\_linux.sh) handle installation and launching. By default, they start the app in HTTP mode.
 
2\. Prepare SSL Certificates
 
* Obtain or generate your SSL certificates:
 
  * For a self-signed certificate (for testing):
 
    bash
 
    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privkey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
    ```
 
  * Place privkey.pem and cert.pem in a directory accessible to Kotaemon (e.g., the root of the project).
 
3\. Modify the Launch Command
 
* The default launch doesn’t enable HTTPS, so you’ll need to customize the Gradio launch settings. You can either:
 
  * Edit the Script: Modify run\_linux.sh (or run\_windows.bat) to pass SSL arguments.
  * Run Manually: Bypass the script and run the app directly with Python.
 
Here’s how to do it manually:
 
1. Open a terminal in the Kotaemon directory.
 
2. Run the app with SSL parameters:
 
   bash
 
   ```bash
   python app.py --ssl-keyfile /path/to/privkey.pem --ssl-certfile /path/to/cert.pem
   ```
 
   * Replace /path/to/ with the actual paths to your SSL files.
   * If app.py doesn’t directly accept these arguments, you’ll need to modify the Gradio launch call (see step 4).
 
4\. Customize Gradio Launch (if Needed)
 
* Open app.py (or the relevant file in libs/ktem/ where the Gradio app is defined—likely libs/ktem/app.py).
 
* Look for the Gradio interface setup, which might resemble:
 
  python
 
  ```python
  import gradio as gr
  app = gr.Interface(...)  # or similar
  app.launch(server_name="0.0.0.0", server_port=7860)
  ```
 
* Update the launch() call to include SSL:
 
  python
 
  ```python
  app.launch(
      server_name="0.0.0.0",
      server_port=7860,
      ssl_keyfile="/path/to/privkey.pem",
      ssl_certfile="/path/to/cert.pem"
  )
  ```
 
* Save the file and run it:
 
  bash
 
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
 
5\. Using the Convenience Script
 
* If you prefer using run\_linux.sh:
 
  1. Edit the script (e.g., nano run\_linux.sh).
 
  2. Find the line that launches the app (likely python app.py or similar).
 
  3. Append the SSL arguments:
 
     bash
 
     ```bash
     python app.py --ssl-keyfile /path/to/privkey.pem --ssl-certfile /path/to/cert.pem
     ```
 
  4. Save and run:
 
     bash
 
     ```bash
     bash run_linux.sh
     ```
 
6\. Verify HTTPS
 
* Once running, access the app at https://localhost:7860 (or your server’s IP/domain if hosted remotely).
* The default port is 7860 unless changed in the script or code.
* If using a self-signed certificate, your browser may warn about security—accept the risk for testing.
 
Additional Configuration
 
* Environment Variables: Check .env.example for any HTTPS-related settings. While not explicitly documented for HTTPS, you can add custom variables (e.g., SSL\_KEYFILE and SSL\_CERTFILE) and reference them in app.py with a library like decouple:
 
  python
 
  ```python
  from decouple import config
  ssl_keyfile = config("SSL_KEYFILE")
  ssl_certfile = config("SSL_CERTFILE")
  app.launch(ssl_keyfile=ssl_keyfile, ssl_certfile=ssl_certfile)
  ```
 
* Port: Change the port if needed by adding --port or updating server\_port in the launch call.
 
Notes
 
* Documentation Gaps: The GitHub repo (as of the latest updates) doesn’t explicitly detail HTTPS setup beyond Gradio’s defaults. The above leverages Gradio’s built-in SSL support.
* Docker: If using the Docker image (ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon), you’d need to mount SSL certificates and modify the container’s entry point, but this is less straightforward—manual Python execution is simpler.
* Troubleshooting: If the app doesn’t start, check logs for SSL errors (e.g., invalid certificate paths).
 
Final Command Example
 
For a typical Linux setup:
 
bash
 
```bash
python app.py --ssl-keyfile ./privkey.pem --ssl-certfile ./cert.pem
```
 
Or via the script:
 
bash
 
```bash
bash run_linux.sh  # After editing to include SSL args
```
 
This will start Kotaemon in HTTPS mode, accessible securely over https://. Let me know if you need further clarification!
